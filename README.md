## How it Works

This webpage is built with pure Javascript, it needs webpack to proper use because has various imports of code, it has his own classes, and it has various little helper functions, all of the .js files are located inside /src folder and jest files on test/.

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
*   Also, you can build this webpage for production, this app it's going to be saved inside the /dist folder, here we can see a main.js file, this is a minified file of the previous files thar are located inside /src folder.
    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```
*   Now the app is ready, you can open the index.html inside /dist folder.
